        <h1 class="blog-post-header">SEO Strategies: Keywords</h1>
        <p>
            A website's keywords are used to align your website with a user's search query - and ideally put your
            website high enough in the search engine's rankings that the user clicks on your site. Improving where a
            site lands
            in a search results page is the purview of SEO (Search Engine Optimization), and while much goes into
            improving a site's SEO, selecting the best targeted keywords for your purpose rests at the heart of a good
            SEO strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
            But what is a good keyword? Ideally, a good keyword (or keyword phrase) is one that has a high search
            volume,
            but a smaller amount of pages serving it. Your content, of course, should be aligned with your selected
            keywords.
        </p>

        <h2 class="blog-post-header" style="margin-top: 24px;">Keyword Optimization</h2>
        <p>
            When trying to research keywords for my portfolio, I ran into an all too common problem: my site has similar
            content to many other web developer portfolios. Most portfolios will have sample projects, a resume, and
            contact page, amongst other common traits, and many will also have projects built with the same languages
            and frameworks. Given this, how could I find less competitive but still searched keywords?
        </p>
        <p>
            To begin my keyword search, I considered my target audience, the purpose of the site, and the content of
            each web page. Since this is a professional portfolio, my target audience are recruiters and other
            developers. Thus, I researched job posting and resume keywords used by recruiters to find developers - and
            found a great article on
            <a href="https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Career/Front-End-Developer/Resume-Keywords-and-Skills" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ZipRecruiter</a>
            that helped me generate some keywords such as "User Experience".
        </p>
        <p>
            Since this is a portfolio site, my name (as it was pointed out to me) would serve as a great keyword. While
            the search volume may not be as high for the general public, it is plausible that recruiters or other
            developers would search for my name.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, I looked at the content of my pages and picked out keywords that related to the content. However,
            this is where most of the research came in. I took my initial list and used resources including
            <a href="https://app.neilpatel.com/en/ubersuggest/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubersuggest</a>
            and the extension <a href="https://keywordseverywhere.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Keywords Everywhere</a> to learn about the
            search volume and SEO competitiveness. From this, I learned that my initial list of keywords included many
            words that were too competitive.
        </p>
        <p>
            To improve my keywords, I focused on finding good keyword phrases - phrases that are more specific, and so
            less competitive. To ensure my keyword phrases are still being searched for, I used
            <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Trends</a> to assess
            the popularity. Google Trends was very helpful in refining keyword phrases, as I could compare two similar
            phrases, and discover which one has a higher search volume. I then used Keywords Everywhere (Ubersuggest,
            after some time, requires a paid subscription) to ensure the phrase had a tolerable competitiveness.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through this process I refined my keywords for my webpages, crafting a list that - while still fairly
            competitive - gives me more of a fighting chance to inch my way up the page rankings than when I
            brainstormed my initial list of keywords.
        </p>
