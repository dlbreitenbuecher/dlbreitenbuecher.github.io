        <p>
            I analyzed the 'Tech Overview' report generated by Google Analytics 4. The date range for the report is August 29, 2021 to September 25, 2021. Because this is a short report, I coupled it with the 'Tech Details: Browser' report

            Responsive web design is certainly a critical aspect to improving one’s SEO. It is essential that web developers, especially those with a front-end focus like me, develop sites that are responsive and deploy well on a variety of platforms. Yet developing responsive sites takes time, and left me wondering: are people viewing my site on mobile devices?
        </p>
        <p>
            For this reason, I wanted to analyze the 'Tech Overview' report. And the results I found surprised me. While I did anticipate more people would access my site from a desktop or laptop than from a mobile device, I was not expecting only 1 out of 36 users - 2.8% of total users - to be accessing my site via mobile!
        </p>
        <p>
            By far the most popular operating system people accessed my site on was windows - 29 users did so. I was surprised to see that 3 users - 8.3% - used Linux. This is the same amount that accessed my site from a mac. As stated above, only 1 user accessed my site with a mobile device, and that device was an Android. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Chrome, moreover, was by far the most popular platform - 30 users accessed my site with this, followed by Safari with 3 users, and Firefox with 1. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Looking at the <a href='../assets/Tech-Details-GA4-report-8-29-21-to-9-25-21.pdf'>'Tech Details: Browser'</a> report, the Firefox user was engaged for 18 seconds, and produced a whopping 18 events in that time. This user was fast, but busy. In comparison, the number of engaged sessions per Chrome user is 37%, meaning that 17 out of 35 Chrome users did not stay one my site for more than 10 seconds, or perform another event to signal engagement with it.
        </p>
        <h2 class='google-analytics-subheading'>Next steps to increase traffic</h2>
        <p>
            Given that my engagement rate for Chrome is 37% - my first inclination is to view the ‘Pages and Screens’ report to understand which pages visitors are viewing, and to learn about the average engagement time for each page. However, I previously had the same page title on multiple web pages, so it is difficult to learn which pages users seemed to engage in most. Now that I have fixed this on my website, I look forward to being able to dig into the engagement time for the different pages.
        </p>
        <p>
            Concerning the <a href=''>'Tech Overview'</a> report - I want to ensure that the desktop experience is a good as it can be - since that is where most of my users are coming from. Given that 19 of my users - over 50% - accessed my site with a screen resolution of 1024x768 - I want to test my website with this screen resolution and see if all the proportions look correct. This is especially important given the layout of my landing page. If it is not rendering correctly, this could be one reason why my engagement rate is not higher.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, while most users come from Chrome browsers, not all do. I am going to test how my site renders on both Firefox and Safari to ensure it renders correctly.
